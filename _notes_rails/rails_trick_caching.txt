It looks like rails is just a series of tricks.  In your rails code, you can set instance variables

@bla = HeavyServerFunction if @bla == nil

Another way to write this is

@bla ||= HeavyServerFunction

That will set @bla to the result of the time intensive function, only if bla hasn't been set yet (presumably by it).
