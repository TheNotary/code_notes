Helpers are just methods.  It's tricky because methods look so similar to variables in ruby, but other than that, helpers are amazingly cool to use.  

To use a helper, simply define a method in a helper module

(app/helpers/users_helper.rb)
module UsersHelper
  def my_helper(string)
    return "The string was: " + string
  end
end


With this new helper method defined in the Users module, you can now use it in the user views:

(app/views/users/show.html.erb)
<h1>
  <%= my_helper "sample string" %>
</h1>

When the show action is activated, it will translate into

<h1>
  The string was: sample string
</h1>


Nifty, huh?
