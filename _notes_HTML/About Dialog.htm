Into the more accessable, Access Database format.<br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<dl>In WorkPro,
<dl>1)  Generate an Inventory Transaction Journal Report
<br>2)  Generate an Invoice Register Report by Emp and Day(x2)
<br>3)  Generate a Sales History Report
<br>4)  Generate a Sales Tax Report
<br>5)  
</dl></dl><br>

<dl>Then in EsckPro,
<dl>Run move new folders.
<br>Point this app to each corresponding report (C:\Genesis\report\*.rpt sort by date created)
<br>
