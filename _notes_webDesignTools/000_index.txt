
This folder is for listing 
                        "Things That Might Come in Handy For Web Development"


That means, if I wind up at a website that has a cool tool that allows web developers to do syntax highlighting to their code files, that link goes in the list.  

Does that also include random buttons and design features that I'd like?  I think I should have a folder for that.
