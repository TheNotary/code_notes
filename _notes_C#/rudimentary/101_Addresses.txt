//  Sometimes it's helpful to know the address of a variable... to do low level stuff and what not...

//    Messagebox.show(Address.ToString());    //  This will show you the location in memory where the variable is
//    Messagebox.show(*Address.ToString());   //  This will show you the value of the variable (I think)

//    *Address = 0x0001;     // this code will set the contents of the variable to 1  I.E.  variable = 0x0001;

// This puts the number 0xffff  into the address of 'p'
