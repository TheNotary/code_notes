public ContactInfo GetContactInfo(SelectSample2 app, int id)
            {
                ContactInfo cInfo =
                    (from ci in app.contactList
                    where ci.ID == id
                    select ci)
                    .FirstOrDefault();

                return cInfo;
            }
            

Look at this example now, it's simpler:

              var x = new List<int>() { 8, 9, 10, 11 };
              var myList = (from y in x where y > 9 select y);
              MessageBox.Show( myList.FirstOrDefault().ToString() );

    
Let me explain.  Consider the list:
              
              var x = new List<int>() { 8, 9, 10, 11 };
              
If you want specific elements from x, you can create a new list by picking out the desired elements, as follows:
            
              var myList = (from y in x where y > 9 select y);
              
Now myList contains every element that was in x which was greater than 9.  
You can get the first element of the new list by the method .FirstOrDefault()

              MessageBox.Show( myList.FirstOrDefault() );

This code can be condensed once you get the hang of it in the following form:

              var x = new List<int>() { 8, 9, 10, 11 };              
              
              int theValue = (from y in x 
                           where y > 9 
                           select y)
                           .FirstOrDefault();
              
              

            
            (from   variable       in       ListToIterateThrough
            where  variable.conditionToCheck  ==  id
            select variable.toReturn)
            .FirstOrDefault();
