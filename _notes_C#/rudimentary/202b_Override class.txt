::override
You can 'override' a prebuilt class's method (only if it's protected??).  
This means you use a prebuilt class, but make subtle modifications to suit your needs.  
In the example you change the .ToString() method to output a string in a specific syntax instead
of what it would otherwise have done (ie it wouldn't have added that colon).


public override string ToString()
            {
                return First + " " + Last + ":" + ID;
            }
