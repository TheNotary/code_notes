1. open your project.
2. Click and drag the Access Database file into the project (in the solution explorer window).
3. Select the tables you want to use (select all tables)
4. And then click OK a bunch if needed.

Now you can refer to musicCollectionDataSet.add() or what ever you want with that object.
