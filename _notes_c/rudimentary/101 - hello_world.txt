You can test all your code here http://codepad.org or to get binaries, go here http://www.onlinecompiler.net
that way you don't need to waste time fiddling with compilers for every single
language you decide to study.  



Create a hello world with out annotations...

(hello.c)
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
	  printf("Hello World!");
	  getchar();
	  return 0;
  }

You can use the online compiler, or you can compile it on linux with the command line:

  $  g++ hello.c -o hello


Then create a hello world with annotations...


  // Include a 'header file' which allows you to use built in functions such as 'printf' and 'getchar'.  
  #include <stdio.h>

  // Create a function called 'main' which returns an int.  
  // Your code will always start here.  and it will always recieve 2 variables automatically, 
  //   First is the count of arguments, 'argc', and
  //   Second is the array of strings containing said arguments...  
  //     For example, when you run your program from the command line like
  //        "c:/dev/c/hello/hello.exe first_argument"
  //     Argc will be set to 2, and 
  //     argv[0] will contain the string "c:/dev/c/hello/hello.exe", and
  //     argv[1] will contain the string "first_argument"
  //
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {

    // this is a call to a function contained in 'stdio.h' which prints a string to the screen.  
	  printf("Hello World!");
	
	  // this is a function that wait for you to press any key
	  getchar();
	
	  // This statement returns from the program back to the commandline from which it was called.  
	  return 0;
  }
