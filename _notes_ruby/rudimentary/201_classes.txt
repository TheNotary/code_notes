Here's a simple class:

[code]
class Person
  def fname
    @fname
  end
  def fname=(fname)
    @fname = fname
  end
  def lname
    @lname
  end
  def lname=(lname)
    @lname = lname
  end
end
[/code]


It can be accessed like:

[code]
my_person = Person.new
my_person.fname = john
my_person.lname = smith
[/code]



We could use this syntax since we aren't really doing anything with those getters and setters:
[code]
class Person
  attr_accessor :fname, :lname  # this will build getters and setters for us
end
[/code]







Static methods...

[code]
class Person
  def self.jog
    puts "I'm running"
    return "I'm running"
  end
end
[/code]

Usage:
[code]
Person.jog
I'm running
=> I'm running
[/code]
